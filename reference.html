The Royal Society, formally The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge,[1] is a learned society and the United Kingdom's national academy of sciences. Founded on 28 November 1660, it was granted a royal charter by King Charles II as "The Royal Society".[1] It is the oldest national scientific institution in the world.[2] The society fulfils a number of roles: promoting science and its benefits, recognising excellence in science, supporting outstanding science, providing scientific advice for policy, fostering international and global co-operation, education and public engagement.

once knew a scientist who worked in the lab all of her waking hours for weeks on end. Indeed I’ve known a few. When a big discovery appears within reach, research can become an obsession. Imagine, then, what it must feel like to lose the race to be first—to be scooped. Months or years of work can become redundant, or worthless. Of no use to anyone.

While I’ve never been scooped on a big discovery in my 25 years as a working scientist, I’m fascinated by the idea of it. Because being scooped drives a wedge between two forces that motivate scientists: curiosity and ego. You get the thrill of learning the answer to the question that has obsessed you, but at the same moment you’re crushed to learn that you won’t be the one who discovered it.

One famous case, especially, captures my imagination. Not only was it one of the biggest scoops in the history of science, but the scientists involved left behind evidence of their reactions. I’m talking about the 1961 deciphering of DNA’s language, the genetic code. Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick, now famous as two of the 20th century’s most brilliant geneticists, worked on this problem from 1953 to 1961, only to be beaten to the punch by a little-known American biochemist.

In 2010, archivists released Brenner’s letters and lab notebooks, and discovered some of Crick’s lost papers mixed in. In the papers, and in the scientists’ actions, I swore I could see their reaction to being beaten to an epochal discovery: They were thrilled.

Or at least they appeared to be. I went to see Brenner to ask him.

SCIENCE HAS LOST ONE OF ITS BRIGHTEST luminaries on Wednesday, July 28, when Francis Crick died at age 88 after a long battle with colon cancer. Crick was co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, pioneer researcher on the neural correlates of consciousness, a powerful promoter of science and critical thinking, and a good friend of the skeptical movement in general and the Skeptics Society in particular. I did not have the opportunity to work with Francis, but every year he made a generous unsolicited donation to the Skeptics Society for no other reason than he believed all scientists should support science education and the scientific exploration of fringe and revolutionary science. I know because I called him once to thank him for a munificent check he sent; he responded by saying that such acknowledgments are unnecessary because he felt it was his duty in the name of sane science and a rational society.

Francis Harry Compton Crick was born on June 8, 1916 in Northampton, England. He attended Northampton Grammar School and later the Mill Hill School in North London, where he showed an early aptitude for science while receiving a basic education in chemistry, physics and mathematics. Upon graduation Crick attended University College in London where he received a bachelor of science degree in1937, majoring in physics. His Ph.D. work was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, during which he helped to design magnetic and acoustic mines for the British Admiralty.

After the war Crick grew less interested in physics and began exploring other areas of science where major contributions could still be made. As he recalled for a Rutgers University honors seminar in 1997:

I used what I call the ‘Gossip Test’ to decide what I wanted to do. The gossip test is simply that whatever you find yourself gossiping about is what you’re really interested in. I had found that my two main interests which I discussed the most were what today would be called molecular biology, what I referred to as the borderline between living and the nonliving, and the workings of the brain.

Crick’s “Gossip Test” led him in 1947 to the Strangeways Laboratory in Cambridge. Although he knew little biology and almost no organic chemistry or crystallography, Crick mastered both, and in 1949 he joined the Medical Research Council Unit as a laboratory scientist in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. It was during these formative years that Crick and his collaborators at the lab worked out the general theory of x-ray diffraction by a helix, which ultimately led to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.
